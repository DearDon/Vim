a repository to write note and keep configuration about vim by myself

vimrc is the configur file with advance plugin(YouCompleteMe and ctrlsf), which may need additonal third-party lib to run.
other plugin are easy to use, you just need to untar the bundle.tar.gz file to get bundle directory. 
bundle contain most of Plugins, except for YouCompleteme as this is a large file(github forbid upload large file). 
you can download all plugin use vundle.
final structure look like ~/.vim/bundle and ~/.vim/vimrc
Enjoy
